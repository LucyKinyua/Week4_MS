Data Investigation with Pandas, Python Data Cleaning & Analysis, and SQL Analysis

In addition, during this weekâ€™s independent project, I got to test my understanding of the following learning outcomes:

1. Recall the basics of Python programming for data science. 
2. Obtain and manipulate data from various types of databases using the SQL language. 
3. Write code and document your workflow in a programming environment.
4. Understand mechanisms for missing data, outliers and analytic implications.
5. Evaluate the integrity of data by making decisions on data quality issues.
6. Perform the extraction, querying, and aggregation of data for analysis in multiple projects through common techniques and tools.

In this week's independent project, I was working as a data scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company. I have been tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time by solving for the following research question: Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
